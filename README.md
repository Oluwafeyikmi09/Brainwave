## Executive Summary

## Overview of Findings

#### From 2016 to 2019, the company experienced consistent and impressive growth. Revenue increased from $6.9 million in 2016 to $18.3 million by 2019 more than doubling in just three years. 
#### This upward trend signals strong business performance, potentially driven by increased demand and improved operations.

#### However the company sales took a turn  begining in 2020. Revenue dropped significantly to $9.3 million , marking a nearly 50% decline from the previous year. This sharp decline aligns with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, which disrupted industries globally. The impact is even more evident in 2021, where revenue is recorded at $1.0 million but it is important to note that this figure represent only two month, not a full fiscal year.

## Recommendations:

#### Based on the uncovered insights, the following recommendations have been provided 

#### • With 75% of orders and 60% of revenue coming from just three product categories, diversifying the product category portfolio is crucial. Expanding the Games & Toys, Audio, Cell Phones and Music,Movies & Audio Books with new product lines would provide upsell opportunities. 
#### • North America continues to be the top-performing continent in terms of revenue. This suggests that the current sales and marketing strategies are highly effectiv in this region It is recommended to maintain these efforts. Australia and Europe are generating very low revenue. A detailed market assessment should be conducted to identify contributing factors 

#### • Currently, 55% of total revenue is generated from a single country, while the remaining 45% is shared across all other countries. While this indicates strong market dominance and strategy execution in that particulatcountry, it also exposes the business to high regional dependecy and potential risk if markt condition changes. To build a more balanced and resilient revenue portfolio, it is recommended to:
#### Diversify Sales Efforts by investing in high potential but underperforming countries
#### Monitor the dominant market closely for economic or policy changes that could impact revenue
#### Invest in localized marketing and sales efforts in underperforming countries 

#### • States showing a consistent year-over-year decline in sales performance should be closely examined. Developing and testing new, state-specific marketing strategies can help reverse the downward trend and boost overall sales performance
